# OBS-NowPlaying

OBS browser source (HTML5 page) for displaying "now playing" from Last.fm or Spotify, scrolls on long titles.

The Spotify version contains a progress bar.

## Usage

### Last.fm

Simply fill your username into the *main.js* file.

### Spotify

Follow the 5 steps described in the *main.js* file.

## Customisation

It's plain HTML5 (HTML, JS, CSS), so this shouldn't be too hard to figure out. Play around a bit!

For my stream, I've added a *div* with a background image and rounded corners:

## API keys

I know sharing secret keys is a bad practice but I figured if those keys get overused / revoked they can always be blocked / renewed and people can just get their own API keys to get this project up and running.
